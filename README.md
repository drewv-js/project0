# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


When creating the website I had a basic idea of a website that gave users a place to quickly view
what movies are out or coming out at a certain time. With websites like ImDB and others it seemed kind of a moot site to make but when using ImDB, though it had a lot of information, it seemed like the site has gotten very cluttered and difficult to wade through. My goal of this site was to give users a quick view of what information they want and they can go on with their day.

Though alot of the tools I use on this site are not completely functional I feel the site, for the projects sake,gives a nice idea of the capabilities it could have and how it could be beneficial to users.

**All information on the site may not be factual or correct. If anything the information on the site is placeholders if anything.

Thank you and hope you like the concept.
